# Handshake

ETHWarsaw Hackathon Project

## Description

This is Handshake. A condition-based reward system for meaningful networks and events.

We built an onchain networking app, that rewards participants of events with cashbacks based on their networking performance. An upfront staking of the participantsâ€™ assets lead to a better overview and plannability for the event organizers. Additionally, the participants are able to return the upfront payment depending on their networking performance on the event. The best networkers are eligible for higher cashbacks and more valuable NFTs.
We built a smart contract in ink! based on open brush templates. We deployed the contracts on the ALEPH ZERO Testnet. We resolved the wallet addresses using the AZERO.ID resolver. The frontend is build in webassembly and hosted on github pages.
It was difficult to connect the different languages, for example the contracts in rust and the contract calls in java script. For a long time, we had problems to understand the numbers behind proofsize, reftime and nonce.
We accomplished to create whole workflow consisting of receiving the wallet address, showing the QR-Code, scanning on other devices, make contract calls and created an evaluate the stored data from the contracts.
We learned working as a team with interdisciplinary skills is valuable. Compared to traditional hackathon setups where most of the team are developers, we focused more on ideation and finding real world pain points that we can address with this technology and during the timeframe that we have during the hackathon. By skipping the part of the frontend development, we could focus on showing the look and feel of the product what would be the attendee experience, which is the crucial part of scaling web3 products.
We are convinced, that our idea has a great potential, in order to help communities grow, help people connect during events and create more meaningful connections. For further development we need to to find partners and build a sustainable and divers team.
